## Colors Organizer (2020)

## How it works?

First, you will see this `Title` interface, where you can put your **PALETT TITLE**.

---

Then, you have to choose the number of colors you want to save in your new palett, so new boxes will be created based on your selected value, like this:

---

So you write down some color values you want to save, and the box instantly will change to the color you're writing:
> **Feature:** it accepts values with and without `#`.

When you're satisfied with your `title` and `colors`, it's the time to click on save button.  
  
On click, it will create a new `Result Box`, that will be filled with your `selected colors`, and with your `palett title`  
just like the example:

And if you think: `Oh god, i accidentally made a mistake, this color shouldn't be here`, you can easily edit it!  
  
This feature allows you to edit the colors inside the `result box`, and the color will automatically change!  
> Like this one:

And obviously, if you want to delete a box, you can just click the `X` button.

> **Obs:** _Browser will not save your colors for now. I'm working on it_.
